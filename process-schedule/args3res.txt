Here is the process list, with the infomation of each process: 

Process: 1, enter_time:  0, need_time: 60, priority: 3
Process: 2, enter_time: 20, need_time: 60, priority: 2
Process: 3, enter_time: 30, need_time: 15, priority: 1

Solution:

FIFO:
Execution trace:
  time   0: Run process 1 for 60 secs ( DONE at  60 ) Priority: 3
  time  60: Run process 2 for 60 secs ( DONE at 120 ) Priority: 2
  time 120: Run process 3 for 15 secs ( DONE at 135 ) Priority: 1
Final statistics:
  Process 1 -- Response:  0   Turnaround:  60  Wait:   0
  Process 2 -- Response: 40   Turnaround: 100  Wait:  40
  Process 3 -- Response: 90   Turnaround: 105  Wait:  90

  Average -- Response:43.333   Turnaround: 88.333  Wait: 43.333
